## DOM-Array-Method-Teach

Here we'll be learning about array methods and manipulation of data fetched from an API. 

## Project Detail
- Fetch random users from the [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) API
- We'll use the forEach method of an array to loop through and output user/wealth
- We'll use the map() method of an array to filter only millionaires
- We'll use the sort method of an array to sort by wealth
- We'll use the reduce() method of an array to add all wealth
